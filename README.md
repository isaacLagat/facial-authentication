Front End:

HTML and CSS create a simple UI to capture video from the webcam.
JavaScript captures an image from the video stream and sends it to the server as a base64-encoded string.
Back End:

Flask handles the image data, decodes it, and uses the face_recognition library to compare the captured face with a known face.
This setup provides a basic web-based facial authentication system. For a production system, you should enhance security, error handling, and user experience.
